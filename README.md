# Pizza Bot Project

In this project we use JavaScript to create a little text-based bot which you can use to order pizza on your computer.

ðŸš¨ *It won't actually order a real pizza for you*ðŸš¨ but it is still fun! ðŸ˜„
This was a pair programming project. According to Wikipedia: "Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently."
